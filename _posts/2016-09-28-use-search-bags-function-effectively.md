When you press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>F</kbd> you are able to search contents of your bags or banks (if you have one opened).
It offers way more advanced search functionality than just searching for item by name.

You can use various types of equipment like `chest`, `helmet`, `gloves` or `off hand`, `ranged` as a search term to filter those.

Then there are special search terms starting with slash:

* `/a` &ndash; artifacts
* `/c` &ndash; crafting materials
* `/d` &ndash; dimension items
* `/u` &ndash; usable items (potions, scrolls, runes, dream orbs, lures, recipes, minion cards&hellip;)
* `/w` &ndash; wardrobe (costume) items

I wish there was something for all equipment items as well.
